Modern Reimplementation of Bitcoin Node Manager
For a modern reimplementation of Bitcoin Node Manager, I'd recommend a full-stack JavaScript approach with these components:

Frontend
React as the UI framework
Next.js for server-side rendering, routing, and API routes
TailwindCSS for styling
React Query for data fetching and caching
Chart.js (with React wrapper) for visualizations
React Table for data tables
Mapbox or react-simple-maps for geographical visualizations
Backend
Node.js with Express.js for the API server
Prisma or Mongoose for database interactions
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
Socket.io for real-time updates
Architecture
Separation of concerns: Clear API/frontend separation
RESTful API: Well-defined endpoints for Bitcoin node interactions
Real-time updates: WebSockets for live data without polling
Containerization: Docker for easy deployment
Environment variables: For secure configuration
Security Improvements
Proper authentication with JWT
Rate limiting for API endpoints
Input validation with Zod or Joi
HTTPS enforcement
CSRF protection
Content Security Policy headers

Example Implementation Structure

│   └── middleware/          # Express middleware
└── docker/                  # Docker configuration
This approach would provide a more maintainable, secure, and scalable application while preserving all the functionality of the original Bitcoin Node Manager.
