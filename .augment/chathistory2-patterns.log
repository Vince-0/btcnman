# Chat History - Implementation Patterns Documentation


## User Request
investigate the patterns summary document and elaborate on each point so that the summary can become a full patterns documentation designed to support AI assisted code generation @.augment/patterns/PatternsSummary.md 


## AugmentCode
I'll elaborate on the patterns summary to create a more comprehensive document that supports AI-assisted code generation.

start the task again but start at 13. Bitcoin RPC Patterns and proceed from there onwards

## AugmentCode
I'll continue elaborating on the patterns starting from Bitcoin RPC Patterns.

## Patterns Documented

### 13. Bitcoin RPC Patterns
- Documented patterns for Bitcoin Core RPC communication
- Included client configuration, connection management, error handling, caching, retry logic, batch requests, timeout handling, logging, and mock responses
- Provided example implementation of a Bitcoin service with caching and error handling

### 14. WebSocket Server Patterns
- Documented patterns for WebSocket communication on the server
- Included Socket.io setup, namespace organization, event naming, authentication, room management, broadcast strategies, error handling, connection lifecycle, rate limiting, and state synchronization
- Provided example implementation of a Socket service with authentication and event handlers

### 15. Error Handling Patterns
- Documented patterns for consistent error handling throughout the application
- Included error hierarchy, middleware, status codes, logging, validation errors, error types, client-friendly messages, serialization, and async error handling
- Provided example implementation of custom error classes and error handling middleware

### 16. Validation Patterns
- Documented patterns for input validation
- Included schema definition with Zod, validation middleware, error formatting, schema reuse, custom validators, sanitization, validation contexts, and partial validation
- Provided example implementation of validation schemas and middleware

### 17. Unit Testing Patterns
- Documented patterns for unit testing
- Included test framework, component testing, test structure, mocking strategy, test data, assertion style, coverage goals, test naming, and setup/teardown
- Provided example implementations for service and component unit tests

### 18. Integration Testing Patterns
- Documented patterns for integration testing
- Included API testing, database testing, test environment, seeding strategy, cleanup, authentication, request helpers, and assertion patterns
- Provided example implementation of API integration tests

### 19. Mock Patterns
- Documented patterns for mocking in tests
- Included dependency mocking, service mocking, API mocking, mock implementation, verification, partial mocking, data generation, Bitcoin RPC mocking, and WebSocket mocking
- Provided example implementation of a mock Bitcoin client and Jest mocks

### 20. Build Patterns
- Documented patterns for building the application for production
- Included frontend and backend build processes, environment configuration, asset optimization, bundle analysis, source maps, build automation, version management, and build artifacts
- Provided example implementation of build scripts and Next.js configuration

### 21. Apache Deployment Patterns
- Documented patterns for deploying with Apache
- Included virtual host configuration, reverse proxy setup, SSL configuration, URL rewriting, static file serving, compression, caching headers, security headers, access control, and logging
- Provided example implementation of Apache virtual host configuration

### 22. Node.js Production Patterns
- Documented patterns for running Node.js in production
- Included process management with PM2, clustering, memory management, logging, error handling, graceful shutdown, health checks, performance monitoring, auto-restart, and log rotation
- Provided example implementation of PM2 configuration and server with graceful shutdown

## Pattern Usage Guidelines
- Detailed how to use the pattern documents
- Included overview, implementation examples, best practices, common pitfalls, and testing considerations
- Outlined a 6-step pattern application process
- Provided an example of applying patterns to implement a "Ban Peer" feature

## Next Steps
- Complete any remaining pattern documents
- Ensure all patterns are consistent with the overall architecture
- Begin implementing the application following these patterns
- Use the patterns as reference for AI-assisted development
